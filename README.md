# WGUC482Project
A project for WGU's C482 Software I course. The application was created to demonstrate comprehension of classes, interfaces, object-oriented principles, application development, exception handling, and user interface development.

WGU's C482 Software I course.

Requirements:

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

Competencies:

Classes and Interfaces - The graduate designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.

Object-Oriented Principles - The graduate implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the applicationâ€™s scalability.

Application Development - The graduate produces applications using Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

Exception Handling - The graduate incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

User Interface Development - The graduate develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.
